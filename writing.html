Hello member of eagles call, I am sending this to you because I want you to help put our nonprofit organization out into the community. Because people need to know that native bee population is decreasing very, very quickly.
<br>
<br>One of the reasons this needs to be out in the public is because native bee populations are dwindling down and we need to fix this. We need to have people know about this because native bees are better pollinators to native plants than non native bees like honey bees. That means that if the native bees population goes extinct almost all, if not all of native plants of Minnesota will die and most likely not come back. 
<br>
<br>The second reason is that if all the native plants disappear then it will also affect the population around it. For example, if a certain animal only eats that plant then that means that animal will die and that will affect other species also it will not only affect the environment here but also in the entire country and maybe expand throughout the entire world. Then slowly the human population may start declining.
<br>
<br>This stuff needs to be put out into the community so please consider putting this on eagles call and also thank you for reading this letter because I worked very hard on this. So please try your best to put this on eagles call and thank you again for considering this.
<br>
<br>Sincerely 
<br>Alejandro
